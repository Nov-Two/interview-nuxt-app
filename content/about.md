Hello, I'm **Zhang Xingguang**, a frontend developer focused on crafting exceptional digital experiences. In this world of pixels and logic, I thrive on turning creative ideas into reality. I firmly believe that great frontend development is not just about functionality, but about creating fluid, intuitive, and delightful interactions for users.

My journey began at **Shanghai University of Electric Power**, where I built a solid foundation in computer science. It was during those days of writing code that I fell in love with the art of blending logical thinking with visual design. Since then, I have been dedicated to finding the perfect balance between the rigor of code and the fluidity of design, striving to ensure that every pixel serves the user experience.

### My Design Philosophy

My development philosophy is rooted in **User Experience** and **Engineering Thinking**. I believe outstanding frontend work must be not only "functional" but also "enjoyable to use" and "built to last."

I am committed to building **high-performance** and **accessible** interfaces. Whether it's component-based development with modern frameworks (like Vue.js or React) or enhancing code robustness with TypeScript, my goal is always to ensure the product runs smoothly across all devices and network conditions. I pursue elegant and concise code, believing that a clear logical structure is the cornerstone of maintainability and iteration.

### What Drives Me

What excites me and keeps me passionate about this work is the **rapid evolution of technology** and the challenge of **translating complex logic into intuitive interactions**.

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing lines of code transform into seamless operations at the user's fingertips. I thrive on the "aha!" moments of solving browser compatibility issues, optimizing initial load performance, or implementing sophisticated animations. This continuous cycle of learning new technologies and tackling challenging problems is the fuel that drives me forward.

### Beyond the Screen

When I step away from the keyboard and monitor, you might find me exploring a new café in the city or hiking outdoors to recharge.
